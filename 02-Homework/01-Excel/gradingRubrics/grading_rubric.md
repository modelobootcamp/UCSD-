# Grading Rubric

### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The assignment utilizes Excel to analyze Kickstarter data. The solution should run without error, producing summary analysis of the data. The source code should also be deployed to **Github** or **Gitlab**.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A, B or C

2. **No, can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

3. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

- - -

## A

* The assignment tasks are completed with the output properly formatted like the examples.

* Minor errors or differing formatting, mostly correct analytical approach, logical assumptions made and stated that create a valid, but alternate answer.

## B

* All assignment tasks are completed.

* One or two major errors, but logic and analysis is mostly on track.

## C

* Both assignments were attempted

* Program has multiple errors, but logic is mostly on track

## D

* Assignment tasks not attempted or significant parts of the homework are missing and incorrect.

## F

* Homework is non existent or barely attempted.

* Nothing can be tested.

### Empty Repository (I)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
