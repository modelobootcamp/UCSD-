# Grading Guide

* To help with the ease of grading this homework it's best to run scripts on the testing data rather than the Stock Data. The submitted screen shots from students will be enough to check that it worked, while the scripts you can run on the testing data.

* Note the inclusion of the letter **P** data set in testing. This is important because a few times in the stock market data the results will return a zero and toss an error because finding percent error will try to divide by a start value of 0. Students will need to figure a way to handle this.

* Before you begin grading, keep a workbook with `alphabetical_testing.xls` open and access your visual basic editor.

* Create a blank module for testing.

* From here you will be able to copy and paste students code and run. Using the testing data will help with run times as some students code can have a long wait time on the stock market data.

* You can see if students code ran, and compares correctly to the solution.

* The difficultly the students submitted should not affect a their grade. A working version of hard is just as correct as a working version of easy.

* Use the [VBA_grading_rubric.md](VBA_grading_rubric.md) as a guide for grading
