# Top Songs Pivot

Pivot tables are exceptionally helpful when dealing with datasets that are large in scale, but contain enough similarities between data points to find commonalities. For this activity, you will be taking a 5000 row spreadsheet containing data on the top 5000 songs from 1901 on and using pivot tables to uncover which artists have the most songs in the top 5000, what they are, and what year they came out.

## Instructions

1. Select all of the data within your worksheet and then create a new pivot table.

2. Make a pivot table which can be filtered by 'year' and which contains two rows: 'artist' and 'name'.

   * All of an artist's songs should be listed underneath their name.

3. Update your pivot table to contain values for:

   1. How many songs an artist has in the top 5000.
   2. The sum of the final_score of their songs.

4. Sort your pivot table by descending sum of the final_score.
