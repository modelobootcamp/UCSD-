# Apples and Oranges

Apples and oranges are two completely different fruits whose data is being stored on two completely different worksheets, but who says that we cannot compare them anyway? In this activity, we will be taking two sheets of data and comparing their values against each other to determine which is the ultimate fruit!

## Instructions

1. In each of the Apples and Oranges worksheets, calculate the average values of the data contained in each column.

2. Create a new worksheet which will be used to compare some of the characteristics of apples and oranges against each other.

3. Create five columns with the headers 'Durability', 'Ease of Use', 'Taste', 'Juiciness', and 'Aerodynamics'. Then create three rows with the headers 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Winner'.

4. Now that we have our basic table, pull in the averages data from the Apples and Oranges worksheets, placing them in their respective cells in our new worksheet.

5. Using a conditional formula, determine whether Apples or Oranges hold the greater average value per column and print which won in the 'Winner' row. In the case of a tie, give the edge to Oranges.

## Bonus

1. Write a formula to determine the "overall" winner by counting which has the most wins. Again, Oranges wins in a tie.

2. Make another worksheet which calculates the averages in the new worksheet itself, as opposed to referencing the averages calculated in the Apples and Oranges worksheets.
