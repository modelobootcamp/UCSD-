# McDonald's Formatting

Despite their attempts to convince people otherwise, The McDonalds menu is not very well known for having the healthiest food options of all time. Looking at a massive table filled with nutrition facts is a pretty daunting task though, so it's up to you to make this spreadsheet just a little bit easier to understand.

## Instructions

1. Add a thin-line border to all values in the table.

2. Add a thick horizontal border which underscores the top row of the table.

3. Add a thick vertical border which runs down the right side of column A and apply text-wrapping to all values in that column as well.

4. Apply conditional formatting to all values in columns C and D which formats cells based on their values and modifies the color of cells so that lighter shades occur for low values while darker shades occur for high values.

5. Apply conditional formatting to columns F, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, and W which turns a cell green when its value is less than 50 and red when it is greater than or equal to 50.
