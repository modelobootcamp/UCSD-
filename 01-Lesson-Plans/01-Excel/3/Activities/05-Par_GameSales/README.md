# Game Sales

Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, you will pair up with one of your classmates in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

## Instructions

1. Create a scatter plot that compares the NA (North American) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

2. Create a scatter plot that compares the EU (European) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

3. Create a scatter plot that compares the JP (Japanese) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

4. Create a scatter plot that compares other sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

5. Go back into each of your charts and modify the axes so that they are consistent for each chart.

* Without consistency of margins between your charts they could be considered misleading.
