# Filtering Game Sales

Now that we know how to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets, we'll take some time to create charts which compare the sales of publishers against one another. 

## Instructions

1. Create a scatter plot which graphs the critical response (Critic Score) of games published by Nintendo as compared to their global sales.

* Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

* Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - paint, Microsoft Word, etc - before moving onto making the next chart.

2. Create a scatter plot which graphs the critical response of games published by Electronic Arts as compared to their global sales.

* Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

* Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - paint, Microsoft Word, etc - before moving onto making the next chart.

3. Select all of the data on the worksheet and create a line chart which can be filtered by publisher, whose rows are set by a game's year of release, and whose values are the sum of global sales for that year.

* Create a 2D line graph that charts this data.
