# Golfing Targets

What better way to express moving averages than with a data set that is all about calculating the average accuracy of a golfer? We had 5 golfers take 20 shots onto a green and calculated the distance to the hole. It is up to you to find the moving averages of their shots using different intervals.

## Instructions

1. Using a moving average with an interval of 2, find the average shot accuracy for each subject. Then create a 2D line graph that charts these values.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - Paint, Microsoft Word, etc. - before moving onto making the next chart.
