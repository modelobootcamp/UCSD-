    "* Everything within the csv is stored as a string and certain rows have a decimal. This means that they will have to be cast to be used.\n",

    "* The csv.Reader begins reading the csv file at the first row. `next(csv_reader, None)` will skip the header row. Refer to this stackoverflow answer on [how to skip the header](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14257599) for more information.\n",

    "* Integers in Python are whole numbers and, as such, cannot contain decimals. As such, your numbers containing decimal points will have to be cast as a `float.\n",

    "* Try the following again but this time using `cereal_bonus.csv`, which does not include a header.\n"
